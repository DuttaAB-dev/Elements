# Elements

A truly cross-platform Periodic table app built with Google's Flutter framework.

The <a href = "https://github.com/go-flutter-desktop/hover">Hover</a> framework was used to build packages such as Windows msi, MacOS dmg, and distro-specific linux packages as the flutter sdk currently only supports packaging as a snap package(let me know if I am wrong).
